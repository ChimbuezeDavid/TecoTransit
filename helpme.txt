# How to Deploy Your Firestore Security Rules

This guide will walk you through deploying the security rules located in `firestore.rules` to your Firebase project. These rules are essential for protecting your application's data and enabling the admin dashboard to function correctly.

## Step 1: Install the Firebase CLI

If you don't already have it, you need to install the Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) on your computer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

## Step 2: Log in to Firebase

Next, you need to log into your Firebase account through the CLI. Run the following command, which will open a new browser window for you to sign in.

```bash
firebase login
```

## Step 3: Select Your Firebase Project

Your project is named "routewise-t6cdq". To ensure the CLI deploys the rules to the correct project, run this command:

```bash
firebase use --add routewise-t6cdq
```
Follow the prompts to select your project from the list.

## Step 4: Deploy the Firestore Rules

Finally, from the root directory of your project (where `firestore.rules` is located), run the following command to deploy your rules:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

After the command finishes, you will see a "Deploy complete!" message. Your Firestore database is now protected by the new security rules, and your admin dashboard should load correctly.
